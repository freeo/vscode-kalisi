# vscode-kalisi

Long-term usability & eye-care are the two design goals of this theme.

- Light theme to enforce proper brightness settings of your monitor
- Pretty high contrast and saturation, but avoiding bright whites (#ffffff)
- Optimized for red light filter programs (tested that keywords can be distinguished at as low as 2300K)
- Functional colors to catch attention where necessary, yet still pretty minimal
