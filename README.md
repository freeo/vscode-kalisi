A light theme for long-term usability & eye-care.

- Pretty high contrast and medium saturation, but avoiding bright whites (most importantly the background: #fafafa)
- Functional colors to catch attention where necessary, yet still pretty minimal (tried to avoid "color vomit")
- Optimized for red light filter programs (tested that keywords can be distinguished at as low as 2300K)
- The red light optimization seems to work as well for deuteranopia (need more feedback on this)

*Kalisi* is actually a family of themes - it's not the first one and definitely not the last: I port this to every tool that I use sooner or later. More releases depend on public interest.
